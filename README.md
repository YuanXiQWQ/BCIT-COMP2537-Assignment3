# Instructions

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to design and develop a web application that allows users to view a list of all the Pokémon, filter them by type, navigate through the list, and get more information about a specific Pokémon.

# User Stories:

1.  As a user, I want to see a list of all the Pokémon available, so that I can choose the one I want to know more about.
2.  As a user, I want to filter the Pokémon by their type, so that I can easily find the ones with specific characteristics.
3.  As a user, I want to see a limited number of Pokémon at a time and have the ability to navigate between them, so that I don't get overwhelmed by a large list.
4.  As a user, I want to see the total number of Pokémon and the number of Pokémon being displayed, so that I can keep track of the amount of data being displayed.
5.  As a user, I want to see more information about a Pokémon when I click on it, so that I can learn more about it.

Requirements:

1.  The web app should have a homepage that displays a list of all the Pokémon available.
2.  The web app should have a filter option that allows users to filter the Pokémon by type.
3.  The web app should have a pagination feature that allows users to navigate through the list.
4.  The web app should display the total number of Pokémon and the number of Pokémon being displayed.
5.  The web app should display more information about a specific Pokémon when the user clicks on it.

<!-- # Deliverables:
1.  [text link] Short YT video (1-2 minutes) that demonstrates the working of the web app. Use user stories to demonstrate the features of the web app.
2.  [text] Self-Evaluation (see Sample below).
3.  [Zip link] GitHub ClassRoom link of your source code. -->
